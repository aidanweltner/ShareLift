  		<p>Effective Date: December 1, 2016.</p>


		<p>ShareLift, Corp (“ShareLift,” “we,” “us,” “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how we collect, use, store, process, and share your information in relation to www.shareiftapp.com (the “Site”) and the ShareLift Mobile Application (the “Application”), and all associated media, printed or electronic documentation, Updates, and support services (collectively, the “Service”). This Policy applies to data you provide when you use the Service and data that gets associated with your account. By accessing, browsing, downloading, or using the Site, the Application or using the Service, you expressly consent to the collection, use, storage, processing, and disclosure of your information, including personal information, as described in this Policy. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS POLICY, DO NOT ACCESS, BROWSE, DOWNLOAD, OR USE THE SERVICE, REGISTER FOR AN ACCOUNT WITH SHARELIFT, OR CLICK TO INDICATE THAT YOU AGREE WITH THIS POLICY. This Policy is part of and incorporated into the Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) governing your use of the Service. Parts of the Terms affect this Policy, so be sure to review the Terms prior to using the Service. Capitalized terms not defined herein have the definitions set forth in the Terms.</p>


		<h4 class="cyan-text text-darken-1">1. Applicability of this Policy</h4>
		<p>This Policy covers our treatment of information that is collected by us, or submitted by you in relation to your access to, or use of the Service, including personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information. When you visit the Site or access the Application without registering for an Account, you can browse without submitting any personally identifiable information. In order to use certain features, however, you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, vehicle information, and mobile telephone number. The Service utilizes services provided by third parties. This Policy does not apply to information collected by third parties, including our third party payment processor or third party Linked Sites. We have no control over, and no responsibility or liability for third party collection, use, disclosure, or retention of your information and that collection, use, disclosure, and retention is not subject to this Policy. Be sure to review the privacy policies of any Linked Sites or other third party sites or services you may access.</p>


		<h4 class="cyan-text text-darken-1">2. Changes to this Policy</h4>
		<p>ShareLift reserves the right to revise this Policy from time to time by updating it and posting it at www.shareliftapp.com/privacypolicy, with the new terms taking effect on the date of posting. You should review this Policy from time to time so you are familiar with the most current version. Your use of the Service after the effective date of an updated version of this Policy will constitute your acceptance of the updated Policy.</p>


		<h4 class="cyan-text text-darken-1">3. Information Collection</h4>
		<p>For various services we offer, we may require you to provide appropriate information as indicated on various forms presented to you. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature.</p>
		<h6><b>We collect the following types of information:</b></h6>
		<div style="margin-left:1em">
			<p>•Account, Login, and Service-Related Information. We will collect personally identifiable information from you when you create an Account. If you create an Account, you will be asked to provide information about yourself, including, but not limited to your first name, last name, and a password selected by you. If you create an account, we collect a unique identifier (“Device Identifier“) for your computer, mobile or other device used to access the Service. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your device used to access the Services, and our computers identify your device by its Device Identifier. We may also collect additional information, including, but not limited to, profile picture, locations, credit/debit card information, gender, and age. If you use the Service, we will collect additional information, including, but not limited to, the origin, destination, rating information, date and time of your Rides, the Riders in your car if you are a Driver, or the Driver of your car if you are a Rider. We will store your Account related information indefinitely and in a profile specific to you.</p>
			<p>•Location Information. Certain features available in the Service, including, but not limited to, requesting a Ride or offering a Ride require us to obtain your location information, including GPS coordinates in real time (“GPS Location”). Your GPS Location may allow us to locate you with a high degree of precision. We use this GPS Location information in order to provide the Service. For example, if you are a Rider, we may use your GPS Location to show you matching Drivers near you who are available to provide a Ride. If the Service is unable to acquire your GPS Location, certain features of the Service may not be available to you. We may collect and use GPS Location information over time to offer you services, protect, enhance or update the Service.</p>
			<p>•Services Information. We collect details related to your use of our Services, including the type of service requested, date and time the service was provided, amount charged, distance traveled, and other related transaction details.</p>
			<p>•Driver-Specific Information. If you are a Driver, we will collect additional personally identifiable information from you, including, but not limited to, date of birth, car make and model, vehicle insurance information, and vehicle picture (“Driver-Specific Information”). Driver-Specific Information will be stored indefinitely in a profile specific to you.</p>
			<p>•Support Requests or Communications. Any personal communications that you or a third party voluntarily submits to us in any format, including by email, postal mail, or any other method of communication, may be collected and saved indefinitely and in a profile specific to you.</p>
			<p>•Automatically Collected Information. Similar to other web sites and mobile applications, we may collect some information automatically and store it in log files. We also use Google Analytics, a third party analytics provider, to collect analytics information about the Service. This collection may include, but is not limited to: your IP address, city, zip code, age range, operating system, browser type and language, referring/exit pages and URLs, other browser history, platform type, device type, number of clicks, landing pages, cookie information, the pages you requested and viewed, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time of each request you made. We collect this non-identifying information in order to better understand our customer base, to more efficiently operate our business, to promote our products or services, and to improve the quality of the Service. We do not link analytics information with any of your personally identifiable information.</p>
		</div>
			<h6 style="margin-left:1em"><b>We may automatically collect information using various mechanisms, including, but not limited to:</b></h6>
			<div style="margin-left:2em">
				<p>◦Cookies. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a computer for record-keeping purposes. We collect information through the use of cookies to understand how you navigate through the ShareLift Platform and interact with ShareLift advertisements, to learn what content is popular, and to save your preferences. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser, and may be accessed every time you use the ShareLift Platform. You may set your browser setting to attempt to reject cookies and you may still use the Site, although some features we provide may not function properly if your browser does not accept cookies from the Service. See the section “Do Not Track Settings” below for more information on how the Service may respond to your browser settings. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties.</p>
				<p>◦Pixels (aka web beacons/web bugs/java script). Pixels are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that are used to track the online movements of web users. Unlike cookies, which are stored on a computer’s hard drive, pixels are small graphics that are embedded invisibly on web pages or in HTML-based emails. Our third party analytics provider may place pixels on the Site that track what other websites you visit (both before and after visiting the Site). Our third party analytics providers use information obtained from pixels to help us improve our business and the Site. We do not control the use of pixels by third parties.</p>
				<p>◦Embedded Scripts. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Service, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>
				<p>◦Google Analytics uses cookies and pixels in order to collect demographic and interest-level information and usage information from users that visit the Service, including but not limited to information about the pages where users enter and exit the Service and what pages users view on the Service, time spent, browser, operating system, and IP address. Cookies and pixels allow Google to recognize a user when a user visits the Service and when the user visits other websites. Google uses the information it collects from the Service and other websites to share with us and other website operators information about users including, but not limited to, age range, gender, geographic regions, general interests, and details about devices used to visit websites and purchase items. We do not link information we receive from Google with any of your personally identifiable information. For more information regarding Google’s use of cookies, pixels, and collection and use of information, please review <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>. If you would like to opt out of Google Analytics tracking, please visit the following link: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>.</p>

ShareLift does not undertake any retention obligations through this statement.</p>


		<h4 class="cyan-text text-darken-1">5. Platform Permissions</h4>
		<p>Most mobile platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without your consent. And these platforms have different permission systems for obtaining your consent. The iOS platform will alert you the first time the Application wants permission to access certain types of data and will let you consent (or not consent) to that request. Android devices will notify you of the permissions that the Application seeks before you first use the Application, and your use of the Application constitutes your consent.</p>

		<h4 class="cyan-text text-darken-1">6. Information Disclosure</h4>

We may disclose your information to any affiliated entity or organization and to suppliers, contractors, agents, and service providers, including third party customer service providers, payment processing providers, support providers, business or sales agents, or other service providers. Use of information by affiliated entities and organizations will be subject to this Policy or an agreement that is at least as restrictive as this Policy. If we provide information to third parties, it will, unless specifically noted otherwise in this Policy, be governed by this Policy and may only be used by those third parties to help us operate or improve our business or the Service and to provide services to us.</p>

		<h5 class="cyan-text text-lighten-3">6.4. Legal Requirements</h5>
		<p>In some cases, we may disclose your information (i) as required by any applicable law or legal regulation; (ii) if we believe disclosure is needed to protect our rights, property, or safety; (iii) to government regulators or law enforcement authorities in connection with any judicial proceeding, court order, subpoena, or legal process served on us or the Service; and (iv) to respond to a threat to you or another person.</p>


		<h5 class="cyan-text text-lighten-3">6.5. Insolvency and Business Transitions</h5>

		<h5 class="cyan-text text-lighten-3">6.6. Disclaimer</h5>
		<p>We cannot ensure that your information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Policy. For example, a third party may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or other users of the Service may abuse or misuse your personal information. No transmission of data over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>


		<h4 class="cyan-text text-darken-1">7. Information Security Measures</h4>
		<p>Keeping your information secure is of great concern to us and the personal information we collect is stored in operating environments that are not available to the public. We use procedural and technical safeguards, including, for example, encryption, firewalls, and secure socket layers, to protect your personal information against loss, theft, or unauthorized access and disclosure. While we have mechanisms in place to safeguard your personal information, no transmission of data or service provided over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. When you provide your information to us, you do so at your own risk.</p>


		<h4 class="cyan-text text-darken-1">8. Children’s Privacy</h4>
		<p>The service is not for or directed towards children. You must be 18 years of age or older to use the Service as a Rider and 21 years of age or older to use the Service as a Driver. Children under the age of 13 are prohibited from using or registering for an Account and we will never knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected information from a child under the age of 13, we will remove that information immediately and delete it from our servers. If you believe User Content from a child under the age of 13 has been posted to the Service, please notify us at: support@shareliftapp.com.</p>


		<h4 class="cyan-text text-darken-1">9. Linked Sites and Third Parties</h4>
		<p>The Site and Application contain links to other sites maintained by third parties (“Linked Sites”). We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of Linked Sites. The Linked Sites may collect personally identifiable information from you that is not subject to our control. The data collection practices of Linked Sites will be governed by each site’s privacy policy and other terms. You may be able to link your account in the Service with a third party website or app that integrates with the Service using an application programming interface (“API”). If you link your account in the Service with a third party, you authorize us to transmit information collected under your account to the third party. In addition, the Service utilizes third parties to process the transactions you request. Any third party with whom we share your information is authorized to use your information in accordance with our contractual arrangements with such third parties and in accordance with their own privacy policies, over which we have no control, and you agree that we are not responsible or liable for any of their actions or omissions. Those who contact you will need to be instructed directly by you regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information by them.</p>


		<h4 class="cyan-text text-darken-1">10. Accessing, Updating, or Deleting Your Personal Information</h4>
		<p>If your personal information changes, you may make changes in the Profile section in the Application. Some changes, such as email address or phone number changes, may go through a verification process so that the Service can validate that the corresponding email or phone number belongs to you. If you change your information, we usually update our live databases immediately. However, some information may update more slowly. We will make good faith efforts to resolve requests to correct inaccurate information except where the request is unreasonable, requires disproportionate technical effort or expense, jeopardizes the privacy of others, or would be impractical. If you would like to cancel your account, you can send an email request to support@shareliftapp.com. If you terminate your account, your information will no longer be accessible through your account or associated with your account. However, activity that occurred prior to deletion may still be accessible by the public and will continue to be stored on our servers.</p>
