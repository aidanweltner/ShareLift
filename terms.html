		<h4 class="cyan-text text-darken-1">2. The Services</h4>
			<p>ShareLift provides a marketplace where persons who seek transportation to certain ski resorts (“Riders”) can be connected with persons driving to those ski resorts (“Drivers”). The connected Driver and Rider may travel together (“Carpool”) for a portion or all of the Driver’s trip.  For purposes of this Agreement, the driving services provided by Drivers to Riders that are connected through the Platform shall be referred to collectively as the “Services”. Drivers and Riders are collectively referred to herein as “Users,” and each User shall create a User account that enables access to the ShareLift application. Any decision by a User to offer or accept Services is a decision made in such User’s sole discretion. Each transportation Service provided by a Driver to a Rider shall constitute a separate agreement between such persons.</p>

			<p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT SHARELIFT DOES NOT PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES AND THAT SHARELIFT IS NOT A TRANSPORTATION CARRIER OR A TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANY. IT IS SOLELY UP TO THE DRIVER TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO OFFER A RIDE TO A RIDER, AND IT IS SOLELY UP TO THE RIDER TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO ACCEPT A RIDE FROM ANY DRIVER. ANY DECISION BY A USER TO OFFER OR ACCEPT TRANSPORTATION ONCE SUCH USER DETERMINES A CONNECTION WITH ANOTHER USER THROUGH SHARELIFT IS A DECISION MADE IN SUCH USER'S SOLE DISCRETION AND IS AT THAT USER’S SOLE RISK. SHARELIFT OFFERS INFORMATION AND A METHOD TO ENABLE DRIVERS AND RIDERS TO CONNECT WITH EACH OTHER, BUT DOES NOT INTEND TO AND DOES NOT PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES OR ACT IN ANY MANNER AS A TRANSPORTATION CARRIER, OR A TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANY AND HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM, INJURY OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF DAMAGE INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY CLAIM RELATED TO SERVICES PROVIDED TO ANY RIDER BY ANY DRIVER USING SHARELIFT.</p>

			<p>SHARELIFT DOES NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR GUARANTEE REGARDING THE SUITABILITY, SAFETY, ELIGIBILITY, OR ABILITY OF DRIVERS OR RIDERS. IT IS SOLELY YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DETERMINE IF A DRIVER OR RIDER WILL MEET YOUR NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS. SHARELIFT WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN DISPUTES BETWEEN OR AMONG YOU AND ANY USER, DRIVER AND/OR RIDER. BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU MAY BE EXPOSED TO SITUATIONS INVOLVING DRIVERS OR RIDERS THAT ARE POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS, THREATENING TO THE LIFE AND/OR HEALTH OF USERS AND/OR OTHER PEOPLE, DAMAGING TO YOUR OR OTHER THIRD PARTY’S PROPERTY, UNSAFE, OFFENSIVE, HARMFUL TO MINORS, OR OTHERWISE OBJECTIONABLE, AND THAT USE OF DRIVERS OR RIDERS ARRANGED OR SCHEDULED USING THE SERVICES IS SOLELY AT YOUR OWN RISK AND JUDGMENT. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE AND BEAR ALL RISKS FOR CHOOSING THE INDIVIDUALS WITH WHOM YOU TRAVEL. SHARELIFT SHALL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY, RESPONSIBILITY, OR OBLIGATION ARISING FROM OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO YOUR TRANSACTIONS OR RELATIONSHIP WITH DRIVERS OR RIDERS AND/OR ANY RIDES OR TRIPS YOU TAKE IN CONNECTION WITH SHARELIFT’S SERVICES.</p>

			<h5 class="cyan-text text-lighten-3">3.5. Safety</h5>
			<p>The Service allows you to Carpool with other individuals who register as Riders or Drivers with the Service. We do not assess the suitability of individuals as Riders or Drivers, and in all cases decline any liability associated with you being introduced to another person through the Service and any related eventualities. While we may perform certain checks to determine the eligibility of Riders and Drivers as documented on our Site, we cannot guarantee that the results of those checks are accurate and up to date, and we do not control the data Riders or Drivers may provide, the ability of Drivers to drive legally and safely, the condition of Driver vehicles, or a Rider or Driver’s criminal background, etc. As a result, there are risks, including, but not limited to, the risks of dealing with: strangers, underage persons, or people acting under false pretenses. Because of the high precision with which we compute your location, it is theoretically possible to trace a location entered in the Service back to a physical location such as your current location, a home, or a work place. It is also theoretically possible that someone could misuse the information acquired through the Service to commit a crime. In all cases you agree to assume all risks, and we disclaim all liability arising out of your use of the Service. Any decision by a Rider or Driver to offer or accept transportation once such Rider or Driver is connected through the Service is a decision made in such Rider or Driver’s sole discretion. It is solely up to a Driver whether or not to offer a Ride. Likewise, it is solely up to a Rider whether or not to take a Ride with a Driver. Drivers and Riders are responsible for all safety measures associated with using the Service, including, but not limited to, safe stopping and wearing seat belts and each person using the Service assumes all risk associated with another person in a motor vehicle. ShareLift does not and does not intend to and does not provide transportation services or act in any manner as a transportation carrier, and disclaims all responsibility or liability for any transportation services provided by a Driver to a Rider using the Service. If you do not feel comfortable sharing a Ride for any reason, you should use another means of transportation. The Service may provide you suggestions, best practices and documentation related to carpooling. These are provided for reference and we are not liable for any consequences arising out of any decisions made by you, regardless of whether the decision was influenced by the Service. In all cases you agree to assume all risks, and we decline all liability arising out of your use of the Service.</p>
			<p>Ratings: At the conclusion of each Ride, ShareLift allows both Drivers and Passengers to rate the other party on how well they performed during the service. This rating takes into account reliability, punctuality, safety, and other factors that are involved in the Ride. Outside of ShareLift employees, ShareLift in no way influences or tampers with the ratings of Users, and Users are solely responsible for providing feedback that determines the average rating of each User. Ratings are provided for reference, and we are not liable for rating or for any consequences arising out of any decisions made by you, regardless of whether the decision was influenced by the Service. In all cases, you agree to assume all risks, and we decline all liability arising out of your use of the Service.</p>
			<p>Connecting Users: ShareLift offers information and an ability to connect Drivers and Riders with each other in order to travel to ski resorts, and does not match Users. It is solely up to the Driver to decide whether or not to offer a Ride to a Rider, and it is solely up to the Rider to decide whether or not to accept a Ride from any Driver. Any decision by a User to offer or acept transportation once such User determines a connection with another User through ShareLift is a decision made in such User’s sole discretion and is at that User’s sole risk.</p>
			<p>ShareLift is not a service for people to meet each other for a romantic interaction. ShareLift does not provide online dating services or act in any manner as an online dating service.</p>
			<p>ShareLift does not intend to provide matching services or act in any manner as a matching service, and has no responsibility or liability for any voluntary match of any Rider by any Driver, or of any Driver by and Driver using ShareLift. User suggestions are provided for reference, and we are not liable for any consequences arising out of any decisions made by you, regardless of whether the decision was influenced by the Service. In all cases, you agree to assume all risks, and we decline all liability arising out of your use of the Service.</p>

			<p>ShareLift strictly prohibits discrimination on any basis including without limitation of race, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity, physical or mental disability, marital status, age, or sexual orientation. By accessing, downloading, or using the Service, you agree you will not discriminate or engage in harassment on any basis including without limitation race, national origin, religion, gender, gender identity, physical or mental disability, marital status, age, or sexual orientation.

In addition, where required by law ShareLift will collect applicable taxes.</p>

			<h5 class="cyan-text text-lighten-3">6.3. Facilitation of Charges</h5>
			<p>All Charges are facilitated through a third party payment processing service (Stripe) and will be subject to such payment processor’s Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy (HYPERLINK), which we suggest you review and make sure you are comfortable prior to use of Stripe’s payment processing services. ShareLift may replace its third party payment processing services without notice to you. Charges will not be made through the ShareLift Platform.</p>

			<h5 class="cyan-text text-lighten-3">6.4. No Refunds</h5>
			<p>All Charges are non-refundable. This no-refund policy shall apply at all times, regardless of your decision to terminate usage of the ShareLift Platform, any disruption to the ShareLift Platform or Services, or any other reason whatsoever.</p>


		<h4 class="cyan-text text-darken-1">7. Payment</h4>
			<p>If you are a Driver, you will receive payment for your provision of Services. ShareLift will process all payments due to you through its third party payments processor (Stripe). You acknowledge and agree that such amounts shall not include any interest and will be net of any amounts that we are required to withhold by law.</p>
			<p>Pricing. You expressly authorize ShareLift to set prices on your behalf for all Charges that apply to the provision of Services. ShareLift reserves the right to change the Charge schedule at any time, in our sole discretion, and we will provide you with notice in the event of changes to the base charge, per mile, or flat rate amounts that would result in a change in the applicable Charge.</p>
			<p>Charge Adjustment. ShareLift reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to adjust or withhold all payment, or a portion of payment, if (i) it believes that you have attempted to defraud or abuse ShareLift or ShareLift’s payment systems; or (ii) it is in order to resolve a Rider complaint (e.g., you took an inefficient route or failed to properly end a particular instance of Services in the ShareLift application when the Ride was over).</p>
			<p>Users accept that given the nature of the service, Drivers and Passengers will have no recourse to ShareLift for any aspect of the transaction, including in relation to cancellation, last minute changes, failure by the Driver or the Passenger to turn up, or non-payment of the Charge. In particular it is the Driver’s responsibility to collect payment from the Passenger at the time of the Ride.</p>


			<p>ShareLift will not contact either party, and will take no other steps whatsoever in the connection of two Users through our platform. The operation of the Ride is solely managed by the respective Driver and Passenger(s).</p>


			<h5 class="cyan-text text-lighten-3">7.2. Livery Conveyance</h5>
			<p>The Driver may collect no payment from the Passenger other than the Charge calculated by ShareLift, as this amount is a calculation of expenses accrued by the Driver (fuel, maintenance, repairs, depreciation, and insurance of their vehicle), and is guaranteed that the total Charge requested from Passengers does not result in the vehicle running for livery conveyance, public conveyance, for hire, or for reward.The Driver must not in any event provide his/her vehicle for livery conveyance, public conveyance, for hire, or for reward.</p>
			<p>If the Driver does receive any hiring charges or reward, or if the insurers repudiate or refuse to accept any claim arising during a Ride for any other reason, the Driver will be responsible for the financial consequences, losses, and damages arising, and ShareLift will not be liable under any circumstances to the Driver or the Passenger.</p>
			<p>ShareLift reserves the right, but not the obligation at its own discretion, to suspend immediately the account of a User including the money displayed, and to make aware to competent authorities any professional activity.</p>


		<h4 class="cyan-text text-darken-1">8. Insurance</h4>
			<p>The Driver agrees and undertakes to take out and maintain a comprehensive valid insurance policy satisfying state and local laws where the vehicle is registered, and covering the vehicle such Driver uses when accepting Riders. Driver has a valid policy of liability insurance (in coverage amounts consistent with all applicable legal requirements) for the operation of such Driver's vehicle to cover any anticipated losses related to such Driver's provision of Rides to Riders. The Driver agrees that they will, on request, provide the Passenger with evidence, in advance of the trip, of the complete validity of their insurance policy. The Driver also undertakes to hold a valid driving licence and that the Driver will own, or will be entitled to use, the vehicle and the Passenger is entitled to request evidence of the Driver’s insurance, registration, and driving licence at any time up to completion of the Ride.</p>

			<p>It is ShareLift’s understanding that governmental authorities take the view that a Passenger who contributes only towards travel expenses is treated as without hire or reward to the driver, and is therefore a third party passenger who is covered by comprehensive third party insurance policy in the United States. However, ShareLift gives no warranty or assurance in this regard and it is the Driver’s responsibility to verify that their insurance provides adequate cover.</p>

			<p>It is up to each Driver and Passenger to confirm with each other that the Driver is covered by valid insurance. The Driver must confirm that their insurance policy allows them to carry Passengers, and that their insurance policy covers all Passengers and any accident or incident which may occur during a trip.
			The Driver and the Passenger are aware that standard non-commercial insurance policies may refuse to cover loss or damage arising in the event that the Driver had made ,or was seeking to make, a profit.</p>

			<h5 class="cyan-text text-lighten-3">8.2. Livery Conveyance</h5>
			<p>The Driver may collect no payment from the Passenger other than the Charge calculated by ShareLift, as this amount is a calculation of expenses accrued by the Driver (fuel, maintenance, repairs, depreciation, and insurance of their vehicle), and is guaranteed that the total Charge requested from Passengers does not result in the vehicle running for livery conveyance, public conveyance, for hire, or for reward.The Driver must not in any event provide his/her vehicle for livery conveyance, public conveyance, for hire, or for reward.</p>
			<p>If the Driver does receive any hiring charges or reward, or if the insurers repudiate or refuse to accept any claim arising during a Ride for any other reason, the Driver will be responsible for the financial consequences, losses, and damages arising, and ShareLift will not be liable under any circumstances to the Driver or the Passenger.</p>
			<p>ShareLift reserves the right, but not the obligation at its own discretion, to suspend immediately the account of a User including the money displayed, and to make aware to competent authorities any professional activity.</p>

Further, unless both you and ShareLift otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Dispute Resolution" section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this "Dispute Resolution" section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>
			
			<h5 class="cyan-text text-lighten-3">12.2. Arbitration Rules and Governing Law</h5>

			<h5 class="cyan-text text-lighten-3">12.3. Arbitration Process</h5>

(The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175 and a separate form for California residents at www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of Delaware and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
			
			<h5 class="cyan-text text-lighten-3">12.4. Arbitration Location and Procedure</h5>
			<p>Unless you and ShareLift otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.

Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>
			
			<h5 class="cyan-text text-lighten-3">12.5. Arbitrator's Decision</h5>
			<p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules.
